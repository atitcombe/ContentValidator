Learning how to be a system's thinker:

A Step-by-Step Process for "Thinking About the System"
Apply this mental checklist before you write a single line of production code.

Step 1: Start with "Why" and "Who" (The Requirements)
Before thinking about how to build it, be obsessed with what you're building and why.

Who is this for? Is it an external customer? An internal admin? A machine?
What problem does it really solve for them? (e.g., "It lets a user upload an image" is the what. "It lets a user provide evidence for an insurance claim without having to mail photos" is the why).
What are the essential functions? List the core actions. This is the "functional requirements" part. (e.g., Must accept a POST request, must save the image, must trigger background processing).
Step 2: Put on the Architect's Hat (The "-ilities")
This is the most important step. Architects think about the "Non-Functional Requirements" (NFRs), often called the "-ilities". For any feature, ask yourself these questions:

Scalability: What happens if 10 users use this feature at once? What about 10,000? (This is what led us to realize a direct HTTP call might fail under load, while a queue would not).
Reliability/Availability: What parts of this system can fail? What happens if the database is down? What if the Azure Function is restarting? What is an acceptable amount of downtime? (This is what led us to realize a direct HTTP call is brittle and a queue provides durability).
Performance: How fast does this need to feel for the user? Does the user need an immediate response, or can some work happen in the background? (This is what led us to the "fire and forget" vs. queue discussion).
Security: Who should be allowed to call this endpoint? How do we authenticate them? How is the data protected at rest and in transit?
Maintainability: How easy will it be for me (in 6 months) or a new teammate to understand this code? Is a simple, direct approach better than a complex but "more powerful" one?
Cost: What Azure resources does my design require? Is there a cheaper way to get the same level of reliability? (e.g., Azure Queue Storage is cheaper than Azure Service Bus for simple scenarios).
Step 3: Sketch It Out (Visualize the System)
You don't need fancy software. Use a whiteboard, a notebook, or a simple online tool. Draw boxes and lines.

Start with your user.
Draw your API. Draw an arrow from the user to the API.
Draw your database. Draw a line from the API to the database.
Now, think about your background process. Do you draw a direct line from the API to the Function? Or do you draw a box for a Queue in between them?
